# Running Windows on the Xiaomi Pocophone F1

## Uninstallation

### Why is this needed?
If you want to uninstall windows use this instead of deleting partitions manually to avoid human error + writing a whole dedicated guide just for uninstalling.

If you want to relock your bootloader you'll need your partition table to be stock.


### Uninstall instructions
> [!Important]
> This will delete all your Android data.
> Must return to android if you are currently in windows.
#### [Method - 1]
- Flash [Moded Recovery](https://github.com/Kumar-Jy/Windows-in-PocoF1-Without-PC/releases/tag/Modified-Recovery) , goto mount and remove tick from all then open terminal, type `restore` , and reboot to system.
- If it stuck on boot logo or reboot to fastboot just boot back to modded recovery - goto WIPE - select Format Data and type `yes` then reboot to system.

#### [Method -2]
- follow [this](https://github.com/n00b69/woa-beryllium/blob/main/guide/uninstall.md) guide  
## Finished!
